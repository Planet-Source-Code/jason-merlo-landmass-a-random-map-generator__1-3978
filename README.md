## LandMass \- a random map generator


</div>

### Description



LandMass is based on the old Commodore 64 game "Lords of Conquest" by Electronic Arts. This game played a little bit like the board game Risk, only there were different playing pieces and --here's the cool part-- the playfield was generated randomly, so that no two games were the same.

As it stands right now, LandMass simply generates a random world based on settings that you can tune. Each world is composed of countries and water. Countries that border each other are shown with a borderline between them. Each country has properties that can be read, such as its color or which other countries border it. LandMass also contains a small example of how to read map parameters and interact with the map.

The program is class-based, which means you can take the Map class and drop it into your own program. And since each map is a separate object, you can generate multiple maps at once. With very little work you can have cool custom maps in your own program!
